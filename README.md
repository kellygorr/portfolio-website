# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup

### Node.js

Node.js is required to install and build the project.

You can find it on the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en).

### .env

Included. Nothing important here, just some global links

### Install

Once you have Node setup on your local environment you can install the project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Dev

Once this is done, build the project.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

Once this is done, build the project.

```bash
npm run build
```
